# Strategic-Ad-Auction-Bidding

### Project Overview

This Python simulation models a second-price ad auction and evaluates bidding strategies in a competitive online advertising landscape. It applies game theory concepts and adaptive logic to promote strategic decision-making for bids based on user click probabilities.

### Tools

Python | Object Oriented Programming (OOP) | Pylint

### Process

1. Conducted background research on second-price auction theory and multi-armed bandit frameworks.
2. Designed and implemented three modular classes:
- 	User: randomly assigned a click-through probability and determined ad engagement.
- 	Bidder: adjusted bids based on expected utility, tracked balances, and learned from outcomes.
- 	Auction: executed auction rounds and determined winning bids.
3. Iteratively tested and debugged logic, ensuring clean, readable code with Pylint standards.


### Results

I created a fully functional simulation that modeled real-time bidding behavior and dynamic learning. This bidder implementation placed competitively among peers, striking a balance between aggressive and conservative strategies.


### Key Learnings

1. Gained hands-on experience designing and managing object-oriented systems in Python.
2. Understood how theory-driven strategies behave in stochastic, real-world-inspired environments.
3. Reinforced the importance of visualizing system architecture before coding and iteratively refining logic through testing.
